# bookbot
a Python program that can analyze an entire book's text and print out an interesting statistical report.
BookBot is my first git project!

This script reads the contents of a specified text file & generates an on-screen report listing
the total number of words & a count of each alphabetical character (ignoring case).

__________
-Separated reading the text file into its own function
-Pass the 'file_path' as an argument to 'generate_text_report'
-Removed the global variable 'file_contents'
-Added main block to call the function

# bookbot
a Python program that can analyze an entire book's text and print out an interesting statistical report.
BookBot is my first git project!

This script reads the contents of a specified text file & generates an on-screen report listing
the total number of words & a count of each alphabetical character (ignoring case).

I've started learning more about functional designs & typing in the last few days.  When I was programming in highschool & college I don't think this sort of expression existed, or at least I had enough going on working through OOP paradigms & mathematical operations (I'm getting better, I swear).

I was struck with a thought while working on this earlier: In our year of the Lord 2023, just how behind do I feel struggling with these basic functionalities & concepts other people much smarter than me built more sophisticated tools with much less.  I mean, a bookbot?  I'm trying to learn & see the light at the end of the tunnel & damn it bookbot, you're going to get me there.
